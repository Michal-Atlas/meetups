# ðŸ“Œ List of Talk Proposals

This page lists talk proposals. Do you have an idea you'd like to see talked about? This is the right place for it. Just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/lang-talk/meetups/pulls).

If you want to give a talk some time in the future you can also add the topic here.
Don't forget to mark it as `ðŸ”§ in the works` to make sure that others understand that you will take care of the talk.
This way you can create some traction for your talk before it is ready to be given.

If you'd want to propose a topic that someone else might pick up and make, mark it as `ðŸ†“ free to claim`.

You can also mark it as `ðŸ›  open to collab` meaning that you will welcome other people approaching you with their ideas or requests - you can decide to give the talk together (ideally though, limit yourself to two or at most three speakers for obvious reasons).

The list:

- Making a Simple Automated Theorem Prover `ðŸ”§ in the works`
- Write Yourself a Prolog in 15 minutes `ðŸ”§ in the works`
- Write Yourself a CLP(FD) Solver `ðŸ”§ in the works`
- Introduction to Algebraic Effects and Handlers `ðŸ”§ in the works`
- Optimize for speed and safety in Common Lisp through Gradual typing `ðŸ”§ in the works`
- Let's oxidize the code `ðŸ›  open to collab` (Artify)
